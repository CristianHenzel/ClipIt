ClipIt-v1.3.4-26112010001 - 2010-11-26 13:44:33 +0200

+ Fixed: Now we are warning the user that his history is saved in a
                plain text file and ask for his explicit permission
                to save the history.
+ Fixed: When the user disables history saving we also ask if he wants
                to empty the current history file.
+ Fixed: Renamed "Find" menu entry to "Manage history".
+ Fixed: ClipIt now complies to the "XDG Base Directory Specification".

+ Fixed: Fixed most of the markup and indentation (replaced double spaces
                with tabs).

                more problems than it solves.

ClipIt-v1.3.0-14112010001 - 2010-11-14 21:03:11 +0200

+ Added: Added "Edit" and "Remove" buttons to the "Manage History" dialog.
+ Fixed: Major speed improvements for big history entries while:
                searching through the history;
                populating the "Manage History" dialog;
                generating the popup menus;
        All of these should now be more than 99% faster, at the expense
        of an (at most) 1MB overhead. I think it's worth it, though.
+ Fixed: Fixed a drawing issue with the small history menu when activated
                by clicking on the systray icon.

+ Fixed: Now using autopoint instead of gettextize to avoid waiting for
                user input.
+ Fixed: Added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE, to get rid of the disable-maintainer-mode
                warning.
+ Fixed: Fixed a small typo in main.c.
+ Fixed: removed dependency of pthread.h (the pthread_exit function that we
                use is also in glib.h).

                now you have the option to disable this behaviour).
